### What I learned
i learnt how to make use of the hover and the active states and also the Flexbox display mode.


```css
.plan {
    width: 255px;
    height: 65px;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 17px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;  
}

a:active {
    color: hsl(245, 84%, 71%);
}

button:active {
    background-color: hsl(245, 84%, 71%);
}
```


### Continued development
During the project i had little bit of a problem making the background responsive, i tried making use of the @media query but it still did not work, or maybe i did not make use of it well. Thanks for taking your time to look through this, Your feedback would be very helpful and Encouraging.
